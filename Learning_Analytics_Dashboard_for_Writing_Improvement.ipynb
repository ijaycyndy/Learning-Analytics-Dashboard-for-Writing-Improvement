Clarity:\\n- Your main idea is clear: climate change is worsening and actions to stop it are insufficient. However, some sentences could be clearer. For example, \\u201cGovernments talk about action but real changes are slow\\u201d could be more specific by explaining what kind of actions or changes you mean.\\n- Try to avoid vague phrases like \\u201cit feels small\\u201d and instead explain why individual actions seem less impactful.\\n\\n2. Structure:\\n- The paragraph would be stronger if you organized it logically. Start with the problem (climate change getting worse), then explain the causes (countries burning fossil fuels), followed by the responses (government talks and individual efforts), and end with your conclusion or opinion.\\n- Each sentence should connect smoothly to the next. For example, after mentioning fossil fuels, explain why governments\\u2019 slow changes matter, then discuss individual efforts.\\n\\n3. Strength of argument:\\n- You make good points, but your argument would be stronger with examples or evidence. For instance, name some countries still heavily reliant on fossil fuels or mention specific government policies that are slow to change.\\n- Explain why individual actions like recycling are not enough compared to big companies. This will make your argument more convincing.\\n\\n4. Suggestions for improvement:\\n- Revise the paragraph to follow this order: state the worsening climate change problem, identify the main causes, describe government and individual responses, and conclude with why more action is needed.\\n- Add specific examples or facts to support your points.\\n- Use clearer language and avoid vague expressions.\\n- Try combining some sentences to improve flow, for example: \\u201cAlthough many countries still burn fossil fuels despite knowing the harm, government actions to reduce this are slow, and individual efforts like recycling seem small compared to the impact of big companies.\\u201d\\n\\nWith these changes, your paragraph will be clearer, better organized, and more persuasive.\",\n          \"Here is feedback you can use to improve your paragraph:\\n\\n1. Clarity:\\n- Your main idea is clear: you believe school uniforms should be banned because they are unfair and don\\u2019t always help behavior.\\n- To make it clearer, try to state your opinion in one strong sentence at the beginning. For example: \\u201cI believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students\\u2019 freedom and do not improve behavior.\\u201d\\n- Avoid vague phrases like \\u201csome people think\\u201d without explaining why they think that.\\n\\n2. Structure:\\n- Your paragraph has two ideas: freedom of expression and uniforms not improving behavior. These are good points but they feel a bit mixed together.\\n- Try to organize your paragraph with one main idea per sentence. For example:\\n  - Sentence 1: State your opinion clearly.\\n  - Sentence 2: Explain why students need freedom to express themselves.\\n  - Sentence 3: Explain why uniforms do not always improve behavior.\\n- This will make your paragraph easier to follow.\\n\\n3. Strength of argument:\\n- You mention uniforms help discipline and focus but don\\u2019t explain why some people think that or why you disagree.\\n- Add a sentence that briefly explains the other side\\u2019s view, for example: \\u201cSupporters say uniforms help students focus by reducing distractions.\\u201d\\n- Then explain why you disagree with evidence or examples: \\u201cHowever, many students feel uncomfortable and distracted when forced to wear the same clothes.\\u201d\\n- Adding examples or reasons makes your argument stronger.\\n\\n4. Suggestions for improvement:\\n- Rewrite your topic sentence to clearly state your opinion.\\n- Separate your ideas into clear sentences.\\n- Add a sentence explaining the opposing view.\\n- Add reasons or examples to support your opinion.\\n- For example, you could add: \\u201cFor instance, some students may feel anxious or unhappy if they cannot wear clothes that reflect their personality.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter revising, your paragraph might look like this:\\n\\n\\u201cI believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students\\u2019 freedom to express themselves and do not always improve behavior. Students need to wear clothes that show their personality and help them feel comfortable. Supporters of uniforms say they help students focus by reducing distractions. However, many students feel uncomfortable and distracted when forced to wear the same clothes.

Clarity:\\n- Your main idea is clear: climate change is worsening and actions to stop it are insufficient. However, some sentences could be clearer. For example, \\u201cGovernments talk about action but real changes are slow\\u201d could be more specific by explaining what kind of actions or changes you mean.\\n- Try to avoid vague phrases like \\u201cit feels small\\u201d and instead explain why individual actions seem less impactful.\\n\\n2. Structure:\\n- The paragraph would be stronger if you organized it logically. Start with the problem (climate change getting worse), then explain the causes (countries burning fossil fuels), followed by the responses (government talks and individual efforts), and end with your conclusion or opinion.\\n- Each sentence should connect smoothly to the next. For example, after mentioning fossil fuels, explain why governments\\u2019 slow changes matter, then discuss individual efforts.\\n\\n3. Strength of argument:\\n- You make good points, but your argument would be stronger with examples or evidence. For instance, name some countries still heavily reliant on fossil fuels or mention specific government policies that are slow to change.\\n- Explain why individual actions like recycling are not enough compared to big companies. This will make your argument more convincing.\\n\\n4. Suggestions for improvement:\\n- Revise the paragraph to follow this order: state the worsening climate change problem, identify the main causes, describe government and individual responses, and conclude with why more action is needed.\\n- Add specific examples or facts to support your points.\\n- Use clearer language and avoid vague expressions.\\n- Try combining some sentences to improve flow, for example: \\u201cAlthough many countries still burn fossil fuels despite knowing the harm, government actions to reduce this are slow, and individual efforts like recycling seem small compared to the impact of big companies.\\u201d\\n\\nWith these changes, your paragraph will be clearer, better organized, and more persuasive.\",\n          \"Here is feedback you can use to improve your paragraph:\\n\\n1. Clarity:\\n- Your main idea is clear: you believe school uniforms should be banned because they are unfair and don\\u2019t always help behavior.\\n- To make it clearer, try to state your opinion in one strong sentence at the beginning. For example: \\u201cI believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students\\u2019 freedom and do not improve behavior.\\u201d\\n- Avoid vague phrases like \\u201csome people think\\u201d without explaining why they think that.\\n\\n2. Structure:\\n- Your paragraph has two ideas: freedom of expression and uniforms not improving behavior. These are good points but they feel a bit mixed together.\\n- Try to organize your paragraph with one main idea per sentence. For example:\\n  - Sentence 1: State your opinion clearly.\\n  - Sentence 2: Explain why students need freedom to express themselves.\\n  - Sentence 3: Explain why uniforms do not always improve behavior.\\n- This will make your paragraph easier to follow.\\n\\n3. Strength of argument:\\n- You mention uniforms help discipline and focus but don\\u2019t explain why some people think that or why you disagree.\\n- Add a sentence that briefly explains the other side\\u2019s view, for example: \\u201cSupporters say uniforms help students focus by reducing distractions.\\u201d\\n- Then explain why you disagree with evidence or examples: \\u201cHowever, many students feel uncomfortable and distracted when forced to wear the same clothes.\\u201d\\n- Adding examples or reasons makes your argument stronger.\\n\\n4. Suggestions for improvement:\\n- Rewrite your topic sentence to clearly state your opinion.\\n- Separate your ideas into clear sentences.\\n- Add a sentence explaining the opposing view.\\n- Add reasons or examples to support your opinion.\\n- For example, you could add: \\u201cFor instance, some students may feel anxious or unhappy if they cannot wear clothes that reflect their personality.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter revising, your paragraph might look like this:\\n\\n\\u201cI believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students\\u2019 freedom to express themselves and do not always improve behavior. Students need to wear clothes that show their personality and help them feel comfortable. Supporters of uniforms say they help students focus by reducing distractions.

        "Interpretation of Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The results show clear differences in how each AI persona contributes to writing improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "• The critic, planner, and supporter personas produced the strongest improvements in clarity and structure. This suggests that direct critique, explicit organisation guidance, and balanced encouragement are particularly effective for helping learners refine their writing.\n",
        "\n",
        "• The explainer persona showed lower average improvements across most metrics. While its step-by-step guidance may be helpful for understanding, it appears less effective on its own for driving measurable changes in clarity and structure within short writing samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "• The combined feedback consistently performs at or near the top across all metrics. This supports the idea that aggregating multiple perspectives leads to more balanced and actionable feedback than relying on a single feedback style.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Reductions in readability scores (Flesch differences) indicate that some feedback led to more complex sentence structures. This highlights a trade-off between improving argument strength and maintaining simple readability, which is important to consider in educational settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "• These findings suggest that multi-persona feedback systems may better support diverse learner needs by combining critique, planning, explanation, and encouragement rather than privileging one approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations:\n",
        "The analysis is based on a small number of sample essays and manually defined evaluation measures. Results should therefore be interpreted as exploratory rather than conclusive. Future work would benefit from larger datasets and learner-rated outcome measures."
